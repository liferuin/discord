# Programs:

### These are programs for MacOS that I use everyday. Paid apps are identified with ðŸ’³. A few of these applications have some sort of monthly/yearly "premium" tier but most aren't worth the price. I'll continue to update as needed.

## AppCleaner
> Better than just simply moving an application to the Trash because it also finds and deletes application files stored elsewhere on your hard drive.

## BetterDiscord
> Customize Discord UI with themes and plugins.
> Website: https://betterdiscord.app/

## Edison Mail
> Free email client that has a touch more functionality and aesthetic than Apple Mail.
> Website: https://www.edisonmail.com/

## LinearMouse
> Utility that allows for more control of your mouse/trackpad. I use it to disable mouse acceleration on non-Apple mice.
> Website: https://linearmouse.app/

## LuLu
> Open-source firewall that blocks outgoing connections to enhance security.
> Website: https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html

## Infuse
> Video player that also acts as a library for downloaded movies and TV shows. Great for those who hate subscription-based streaming services and instead sail the high seas to find movies and TV series. Best of all, it has an Apple TV app so you can watch files stored on your Mac/PC on your Apple TV (because Apple screen mirroring is still ass).

## Mimestream ðŸ’³
> __$5/month or $50/year__
> The best Gmail client for MacOS, if you're a power-emailer then it's worth the price. If you're a casual user, probably stick with Apple Mail or Edison Mail.

## Rectangle
> "Snap" windows to designated areas on your screen (like Windows).
> Website: https://rectangleapp.com/

## Spicetify
> Customize Spotify UI with different themes and extensions.
> Website: https://spicetify.app/

## TickTick
> Feature-packed to-do list app with a clean UI. You can use on Windows too but better on MacOS and iOS in my opinion.
> Website: https://ticktick.com/

## Transmission
> My bittorrent client of choice, very simple and easy to use.
> Website: https://transmissionbt.com

## Ulysses ðŸ’³
> __$6/month or $40/year__
> Notes app on steroids.
> Website: https://ulysses.app/
