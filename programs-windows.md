# Programs:

### These are programs for Windows that I use every day. Most are free, paid apps are identified with ðŸ’³. I'll continue to update as needed.

## [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org)
> File archiver (.zip, .rar, etc.), faster than WinRAR.

## [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
> Create scripts to customize Windows' actions. I use a few for program-specific keybinds.

## [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)
> Customize Discord UI with themes and plugins.

## [Bulk Crap Uninstaller](https://www.bcuninstaller.com/)
> Thoroughly remove/uninstall applications.

## [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)
> Find files on your system instantly - much faster than Windows' built-in search.

## [Internet Download Manager](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) ðŸ’³
> __$12/year or $25 lifetime__
> Download manager compatible with most browsers. Accelerates download speeds and times by simultaneously downloading segments of files and re-attaching them at the end.

## [JPEGView](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview)
> Minimal image viewer/editor.

## [NVCleanInstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall/)
> Reinstall NVIDIA drivers without the bloat and telemetry, may decrease input lag in-game.

## [Powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)
> Utilities and tweaks for Windows' UI.

## [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/)
> Customize Spotify UI with different themes and extensions.

## [VibranceGUI](https://vibrancegui.com/)
> Adjust NVIDIA's digital vibrance for specific programs. Great for when you want to get more vibrant colors in a game, but go back to normal on desktop.

## [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
> Media player that works with just about any format/codec.

## [Voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/)
> Audio mixer, I use it to re-route audio for streaming/gaming, as well as monitor my own microphone.
